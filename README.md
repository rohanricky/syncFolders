# syncFolders

run <code>python3 server/web.py</code> to start the server.

The watch.py code points to Droid A & B. change the path to the desired directories and run the script.<br />

<code>Note:watch.py script should run at all times for sync to happen.</code> <br /> <br />
It can be implemented as daemon with daemon.py.<br />

if you want to sync run <code>python3 sync.py</code>.
